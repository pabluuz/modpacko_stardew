Description
This mod adds an app for the Tractor on the phone, so that you're able to summon the tractor from the phone. Requires SMAPI, Tractor Mod﻿, and Mobile Phone﻿ to be installed.

This mod has no affiliation to the Tractor Mod. All it does is bind a key click to the app icon (the default key is "Back" for Backspace), so if you change the key for the Tractor Mod, you'll have to change the key specified in this app's content.json as well!

2. Install Tractor Mod﻿ (version 4.11.2 or higher) and Mobile Phone﻿
